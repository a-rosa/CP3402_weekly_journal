# Week 8 Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources:
Theory: I learn better when there is a vizualization or a step by step process on things that I don't understand or can't do.
Steps: If there is anything that I don't understand such as how to set VVV, I can do these following steps:
1. Search about VVV in Google
2. Find a website that provides a step by step process on how to set up VVV
3. Complete the step by step process according website

I can do the process above or another process:
1. Open Youtube, and search about the topic concerned
2. Click on a video that will let me understand the topic
3. If the video is not good as in I still don't understand, then find another video 

As a control, the process would be:
1. Search up about the topic concerned
2. Find a website that are only full of writing or no examples

These steps will give a control and what is being experimented on. If in the experimented process, step by step website or a video from Youtube, gives me more understanding than reading a website without any examples, then it proves that my theory is correct. 

## Estimated hours:
About 1 hours

## Content Insights:
I did not learn much this week for the practical since the submission is to create a methodology for learning experiment.

## Carrer/Employability/Learning Insights:
I think this practical is useful as it is similar to reflecting and making a experiment to test out whether what you found out about yourself is correct or not. I think I would apply this method of repflecting and experimenting to understand myself better. If my theory about myself is correct, I can later use it to my own advantage.

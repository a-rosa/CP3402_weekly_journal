The first website above taught me the different localhost software there are that are suitable for Windows 10. The second website was found because I encountered a problem with the mySQL for XAMPP. The third website shows how to install Wordpress to XAMPP and test out that the XAMPP works.


## Estimated hours:
About 2 hours

## Content Insights:
I learned the different localhost services that are out there and XAMPP came on top as the most common used localhost software. I didn't learn how to install it because I have it already installed. Instead I had a problem with mySQL not working so I had to search and learned that it can be fixed by killing the process that is taking the port for mySQL server to work. Then I also needed to test out the Apache server so I tested it using Wordpress which is another learning lesson on how to install Wordpress into XAMPP.

## Carrer/Employability/Learning Insights:
Learning about how to locally host the website is something interesting and I also understood the importance as it helps in testing the website either done by coding or using CMS such as Wordpress. I also found out that not only youtube videos can help guide me in finishing the task, but also websites with pictures and clear steps written help in launching and testing the localhost.

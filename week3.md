# Week 3 Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources:
None

## Estimated hours:
About 4 hours

## Content Insights:
I didn't learned much for this time since most of the heavy work is learned during the assignment process. So I basically applied what I learned from the previous assignment and trasnfer the contents from Joomla to the Wordpress.

## Carrer/Employability/Learning Insights:
I found out that after learning intensively, I could still remember how to do it right after. I also learned that picking a good theme that lets you customize easily is better as I had a much better time compared to when I was doing assignment. A good theme means that there is better customizability and that it doesnt have to be related or straight away appealing to the target market as the good customizability allows you to change the color as you want easily making it suit the target audience more easily.

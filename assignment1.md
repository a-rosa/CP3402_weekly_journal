# Assignemnt 1 Journal

## Website:
For this assignment 2 websites should be made and both websites should have a relationship as in they should be in the same industry but different target market. Because of this, I did not reuse my previous practical joomla website because I thought it might harder to do the second website. Therefore, I choose to make clothes or fashion websites. 

## Wordpress Website:
In this website, the goal is supposedly to make customers see the different clothes or options offered and buy it. However the buy goal would be a bit hard since I am not sure how to make a shop button. So, the goal of the website is to show the opions of the shop and if customers want to buy, there is a contact us in the footer where they can see and contact instead. This website is different from the other website is because the target market for this website is kids. Hence, the website is made to appeal more towards kids.

## Joomla Website:
In this website, the goal is to show clothes for men and appeal to male customers to buy them. Again, the button is not there but there is a contact for the customers to be able to contact the shop. This website is different from the wordpress website because the target market is more towards adult males so the design of the website is also more mature and neutral. It is also towards people in the middle class due to the price being just affordable but not cheap.

## Learning Activities:
Videos are used to understand how to use Wordpress and Joomla.

## Content Insights:
I learned and relearned how to use Joomla. This is because before there was a chance to use Joomla and I used what I have learned and apply it again but there are also some features that I have not used before in Joomla that I learned during this assignmet such as drop down menu. The casseiopia theme from Joomla turns out that we need to activate the collapsable feature so that the drop down menu can happen. Besides that, I also learned how to use Wordpress, however I found out during the making and learning of it that there isn't any good videos about Wordpress mainly because there is no help in understanding how to use themes. In the video I saw, I had a precognition that I have to pick a theme that suits the market target, which in that case was the kids. But after that there is no reference of help in how to use the theme chosen which makes it hard. Also during the making of Wordpress apparently some features of the theme are not supported so there are also some problems about that too. But I found that Wordpress allows you some editors that directly edits the page layout which helps greatly in making the website look how I want it to look. 

So, in all I learned new features of Joomla which is how to make drop down menu, learned that the theme of Wordpress doesn't have to fit the target audience you pick as the pictures and colors can be changed to fit it, adn learned that Wordpress has an editor that makes editing easier of layout.

## Carrer/Employability/Learning Insights:
I learned that for me Joomla seems easier to use rather than Wordpress however, Wordpress looks more cleaner and nicer as compared to Joomla. This might have been because I have used Joomla and I have no experience at all in using Wordpress CMS. I also learned how other shops make their own website adn use it as a reference to make the website which includes how to subdivide the products as, what products that are appealing and what is shown in the front page of the website.

## Content Insights:
I learned how to make child theme. The initial process of creating the child theme is not hard however the child style.css was not loading the changes I made and changing the parent theme. I searched online, a common reason was because the child theme is loaded first then the parent theme but that was not the case for me since the child theme itself is not loading. Therefore, I could only make a replica of the inital theme folder and rename that as the child version folder. 

## Carrer/Employability/Learning Insights:
I think I am not used to making child themes and I am also not sure whether I would use them again since I am not planning to work towards web development as a career. It is a good thing to learn about but the complex problem of the child theme not loading and that there was no solution online makes me think that child theme is complex to do. And that it would be much simpler if I can just copy the parent theme folder and rename the copied version as the child theme instead and work with that.

## Learning Activities & Resources:
Learned how to install and use Jooml


## Estimated hours:
About 8 hours

## Content Insights:
I learned how to install and use Joomla in a free hosting website. I see that with Joomla there making website becomes easier and more user friendly. However there are some things that I find hard to complete such as formatting the text. This may have been because I am new to Joomla and is not used to using Joomla. 

## Carrer/Employability/Learning Insights:
I found out that text based help is not really helpful to me and if there is a video of someone showing how to use Joomla helped alot. I also found out that if I have problems, it would be best to ask around to get insight on where I am misunderstanding at.

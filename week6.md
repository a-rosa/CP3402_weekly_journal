The link shows how to integrate github with slack

## Estimated hours:
About 3 hours

## Content Insights:
I made the trello and the slack along with the integration. I knew a bit of trello and it was quite easy to work my way around to make a new workspace and board for the group assignment. I also make a new workspace and account in slack which was easy but the integration was a bit confusinng so I had to check with the site listed above. But I was able to get the integration with github and trello going. 

## Carrer/Employability/Learning Insights:
From looking around slack, it seems that it is a good way to communicate easy since there is integration with github and trello which keeps progress up to date easily. I used a bit of trello before and it seems like a good tool to use to keep track of what needs to be done, what task is being completed and what tasks are done. So, maybe in the my future career, I can use these 2 tools to help me keep up with the progress.
